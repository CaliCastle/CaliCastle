### Hi there 👋

I'm Founder and CEO at [Zolplay](https://zolplay.com) (https://github.com/zolplay-cn)

I am also the Crew Lead and Chief Tech Artisan who provides direction 🧑🏻‍🚀 while we're roaming and wandering in the uncharted galaxy 🪐. 

You can also find me on [read.cv](https://read.cv/cali).

I am mainly responsible for writing and managing project specs and documentations, creating slides and sheets, and also participanting in both front-end and back-end development, and ✨ sprinkling in some UI/UX design from time to time.

Fun facts:
- I used to play MIDI controllers like Launchpad and produce EDMs (https://youtu.be/XFldHTzMFQw)
- I used to rap and do Eminem song covers and released Mixtapes in China.
- I love Open Source projects and also created an iOS menu library called [PopMenu](https://popmenu.cali.so)
- I am a huge Apple fan and obsessed with SwiftUI
- I created an extension for the [Raycast](https://raycast.com) store:
